                <p class="paragraph">
                    I am a self-taught Front-end Web developer from Abohar, India.
                    About four years ago is when I started my learning journey on how to make
                    web stunning and responsive. I have always been a curious individual, which is 
                    why I would love to collaborate and do some real-life projects in order to flourish 
                    my skills. I'm not perfect, however. I find learning a Fascinating process. I am currently
                    learning ReactJS, and planning to learn NodeJS for back-end development.
